# “Learning about Version Control”
Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

Honestly, I don't have any strong opinions on version control yet as I'm very new to it. Putting stock in any self developed opinions this early using something new seems irrational. Seeing as how I have to answer the question: I like how developed github is and that people are this organized in their version control for their projects. I dislike that it's not immediatly understandable.
